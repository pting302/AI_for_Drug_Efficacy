# AI_for_Drug_Efficacy
The goal of this project is to develop a reliable model that can predict the efficacy of a given drug to help pharmaceutical companies best allocate resources.
AI could assist pharma companies in getting medicines to market faster in predicting drug efficacy and side effects. A few techniques important to pharma companies are machine learning, which applies trained pattern-matching and statistical analysis to spot trends or predict outcomes, as well as natural language processing (NLP), which parses human-written words to deduce their meaning, and can also develop sentences that mirror human writing. More recently, is the implementation of 3D CNN's to predict the Binding Affinity of a drug to certain specimen, including bacteria and other harmful organisms.
